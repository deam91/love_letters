This application is part of the April challenge (2022) for Flutter.

See the details at https://flutterchallenge.dev/love-letters

## Goals

✅ The game can be played by 2 person

✅ The pigeon can be sent by tapping the screen

✅ There is a power meter that determines the power of your pigeon

✅ The red bar in the power meter should go from left to right and right to left until the player touches the screen.

✅ If the red bar stopped between the 90-90 area in the middle of the power meter, your pigeon can deliver the letter to your loved one. Otherwise, the pigeon fails.

✅ You'll need to animate the pigeon based on the power.

✅ If it has got enough power it flies from one castle to the another.

✅ If it has not got enough power it flies straight until it has power and falls down after that until it goes out of the screen.

✅ You'll need to animate the red bar in the power meter.

✅ You'll need to increase the score of the players of the letter is delivered.

✅ The game ends after each player tried to send 5 letters.
